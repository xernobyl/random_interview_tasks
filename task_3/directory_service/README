Server for directory service.

Fully asynchronous, and does not use GraphQL. Sorry.
Use "npm start" to run. The root directory can be changed on the settings.json file. The default might be super useful.

Uses a REST API with a single GET request: GET files/PATH, where path is the desired path to explore.
