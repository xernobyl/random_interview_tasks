# Random interview tasks
Monorepo with random bits and pieces of code I've been doing for job interviews

These are some random bits and pieces of code I've been doing while trying to look for a job. Includes a growing number of languages and frameworks. Code is provided as is, quality and project completion varies. Each folder reppresents a specific task, which may or may not be finished. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
