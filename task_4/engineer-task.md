# Create a TODO list API

## Overview

We want you to create a simple TODO list API (just the backend). You can use whatever tech stack or data structures that you would like, but the programming language should be plain Javascript. It is up to you how much time you want to spend, but obviously you want to get your submission in fairly soon, so don't spend crazy amounts of time ðŸ˜€.

Submit your code in a *private* repo and share with me. ~REDACTED~ Submission of your project to a public repo is an instant fail ðŸ˜›.

## Minimum requirements

These requirements are intentionally vague. It is up to you to design a nice architecture.

* Each todo item is at it's simplest just a string
* We must be able to create, delete and fetch todo items.
* We should be able to group items into lists somehow.
* You should provide a working demo: either clear instructions on how to get it working or provide a live running demo

## Bonus points

You will get bonus points for the following:

* Unit tests
* Documentation
* Any functionality you think a TODO API should have over and above minimum requirements.
